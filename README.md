# Triangle Printer

This repository contains the solution for the **Triangle Printer** assignment. The program prints a triangle pattern based on the number of lines provided by the user. The user can input a number between 1 and 50, and the program will generate a symmetrical triangle with numbers. The user can keep entering values until they type "q" to quit the program.
